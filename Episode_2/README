TITEWALK SCREENCASTS: 
Episode 2: Monitoring Network Connectivity Status

Any good web / online based application should be able to detect whether or not a user is connected or disconnected from the internet. Furthermore, the application should notify the user immediately when a connection drops to ensure that he or she does not loose data. In this episode we'll look at how to make that happen using the Titanium.Network class.
