TITEWALK SCREENCASTS: 
Episode 3: Titanium Notifications

Everyone needs to handle notifications. And even though we can always use the javascript “alert dialogue” Titanium gives us a much more integrated option to handle alerts using the Titanium.Notification namespace.

NOTE: Notifications appear differently on different operating systems but they can be called programmatically the same way. On the screen cast I’m using a Mac with my growl notifications setup to come from the bottom. Your notifications may come from another corner (top /bottom right in most cases) depending on your OS and settings.
